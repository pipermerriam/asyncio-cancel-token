Cancel Token
============


Introduction
------------

A `~cancel_token.CancelToken` is used to trigger cancellation of async
operations.  This is useful for ``asyncio`` based python applications which
need a sane pattern for cancelling or timing out.


Quick Start
-----------

.. doctest:: python

   >>> import asyncio
   >>> from cancel_token import CancelToken, OperationCancelled
   >>> async def run_and_cancel_task():
   ...     async def some_task(token):
   ...         print("started task")
   ...         await token.wait()
   ...         print('task cancelled')
   ...     token = CancelToken('demo')
   ...     asyncio.ensure_future(some_task(token))
   ...     # give the task a moment to start
   ...     await asyncio.sleep(0.01)
   ...     # trigger the cancel token
   ...     token.trigger()
   ...     # give the task a moment to complete
   ...     await asyncio.sleep(0.01)
   ...
   >>> loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
   >>> loop.run_until_complete(run_and_cancel_task())
   started task
   task cancelled


Basic Usage
-----------

Creation of a `~cancel_token.CancelToken` simply requires providing a name.


.. doctest:: python

    >>> CancelToken('demo')
    <CancelToken: demo>


Cancel tokens are triggered by calling the
:meth:`~cancel_token.CancelToken.trigger` method.  Triggering a cancel token
causes the following behaviors.

- The property :attr:`~cancel_token.CancelToken.triggered` will return ``True``
- Any calls to the coroutine :meth:`~cancel_token.CancelToken.wait` will return.
- Any calls to the method :meth:`~cancel_token.CancelToken.raise_if_triggered` will raise an `~cancel_token.OperationCancelled` exception.

From within your application, you might use the cancel token any number of
ways.

Loop exit condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The property :attr:`~cancel_token.CancelToken.triggered` can be useful as the
conditional for a ``while`` loop.

.. code-block:: python

    async def my_task(token):
        while not token.triggered:
            ... # do something

Or you may want to break out of the loop in a less gracefull manner by raising
the `~cancel_token.OperationCancelled` exception.

.. code-block:: python

    async def my_task(token):
        while True:
            token.raise_if_triggered()
            ... # do something


Waiting for an external signal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    async def main():
        token = CancelToken('worker')

        asyncio.ensure_future(do_work(token))
        # wait for work to be completed before proceeding
        await token.wait()


Chaining Tokens
---------------

One of the more useful patterns is token chaining.  Chaining can be used to
create a single token which will trigger if any of the tokens it is chained to
are triggered, 


.. doctest:: python

    >>> token_a = CancelToken('token-a')
    >>> token_b = CancelToken('token-b').chain(token_a)
    >>> token_a.triggered
    False
    >>> token_b.triggered
    False
    >>> token_a.trigger()
    >>> token_a.triggered
    True
    >>> token_b.triggered
    True

In this example we create ``token_b`` which has been chained with ``token_a``.
``token_b`` can be triggered independently, not effecting ``token_a``.
However, if ``token_a`` is triggered, it also causes ``token_b`` to be
triggered.


Integration with other async APIs
---------------------------------

Within the boundaries of your own application it is easy to pass cancel tokens
around as needed.  However, you will often need cancellations to apply to async
calls to apis which do not support the cancel token API.

The :meth:`cancel_token.CancelToken.wait_for` function can be used to enforce
cancellations and timeouts on other async APIs.  It expects any number of
awaitables as positional arguments as well as an optional ``timeout`` as a
keyword argument.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import asyncio
    >>> from cancel_token import CancelToken
    >>> loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    >>> token = CancelToken('demo')
    >>> async def some_3rd_party_api():
    ...     await asyncio.sleep(10)
    ...
    >>> loop.run_until_complete(token.wait_for(some_3rd_party_api(), timeout=0.1))
    TimeoutError
